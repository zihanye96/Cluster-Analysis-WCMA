# Instructions

This is a Shiny app designed to to give users customized recommendations from the WCMA collection based on their artistic preferences. With the exception of the WCMA collection's image files (3GB total), all other files needed to run the app are included in this folder. The images of WCMA's digital art collection can be downloaded [here](https://rs.williams.edu/pages/view.php?ref=92421&k=0e4c94d372).

To run this app locally, simply clone this repository, and place the folder containing the downloaded image files (rename it "WCMA Public Thumbs") in the folder called "App". Then, open the file "App.R" and launch the application in R.
