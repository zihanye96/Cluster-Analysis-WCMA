# Digital Art Recommender
The goal of this project is to analyze image data from the Williams College Museum of Art (WCMA)'s digital art collection and cluster the collection using sets of newly defined features that aim to capture (dis)similarity outside of traditional criterion (ex. artist, date, and genre). After clustering the collection, I created a web application (via Shiny) that gives the user customized recommendations from the WCMA collection based on their artistic preferences.

The [report](report.md) discusses the project in more detail. The image files used can be downloaded [here](https://rs.williams.edu/pages/view.php?ref=92421&k=0e4c94d372). This project was done in collaboration with Yolanda Zhao at Williams College.
